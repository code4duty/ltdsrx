{"doc_id": "LIPITOR.546", "text": "I had been taking Lipitor 10mg for 2 years.\nAbout 6 mons. ago, I decided to tell my Dr I was having muscle pain and leg cramps.\nHe switched to Pravachol 20mg.\nI lasted about 2 weeks.\nThe pain was worse.\nThen I decided to look on the internet to find out what was causing the pain.\nIt was Statin.\nI looked that up and found what it does to the body.\nSo, I decided to stop taking any drug and take some Q10 to build my body back up.\nTwo months later went back on Lipitor with the Q10.\n2 months later, the pain was back.\nTwice as bad as before, plus a whole bunch of other side effects, you see I'm seriuosly allergic to the Statin.\nAnd I know now, why I should have known this, but no one told me about it.\nWhen you are taking Statin and drink alcohol the side effects increase dramatically.\nWhen ever I drank, sipped a little wine, by body hurt so bad, I thought I had the flu.\nAnd no Aleve, or pain killer would help.\nI thought I was allergic to the alcohol.\nBut now I know it was the Statin.\nHere are a list of the side-effects I had, that started slowly and in two years, became unbearable: Insomina,abnoraml dreams, depression, memory loss, photosensitivity, muscle pain, leg cramps, rhinitis, bronchitis, asthma, dry skin, tinnitus (left ear) taste loss, dry eyes, weight gain and finally hypertension.\nDuring the two years, I was on the Lipitor, all these syptoms started out slowly.\nFirst came the tinnitus.\nMy Dr sent me to the ear Dr.\nFound no problem, I would have to live with it.\nSecond, came depression, Dr put me on Zoloft.\nThen came the sinus problems, Dr put me on Rhinocort.\nDuring all this I felt like I was 80 years old.\nMy neck hurt, my hips hurt.\nWe got a $3,000.00 sleep by number bed to relieve the pain.\nDidn't really help.\nInsomia was constant.\nI got hooked on Tylenol PM.\nI gained a lot of weight.\nWent to Lindora to loss weight, so I could get off the Lipitor.\nLost 40 lbs.\nDr said to stay on Lipitor for prevention.\nThis is when I decided to check it out on the internet.\nWhen I went back on the Lipitor, about 2 months ago, I had a small drink of wine at a wedding.\nThat night my body aches were so bad, I could hardly stand it.\nThen two days later I came down with bronhitis, and asthma.\nI have asthma anyway, but it was the worse case I've had in 13 years.\nThen I had sinus problems again.\nMy Dr took x-rays for pneumonia and sinus infection, Came back clear.\nMy Dr wanted me to see an ear nose and throat Dr Then my blood pressure went up to 198/90.\nI have never in my life had high blood pressure.\nDr put me on Norvasc.\nThen I had two horrible nightmares.\nI finally, went on the internet and looked at side effects for Lipitor.\nWhen I saw all the side-effects, I nearly died.\nI have all the syptoms.\nI stopped taking Lipitor that instant.\nThat was one week ago.\nI'm starting feel a little better.\nI've gone to my Dr and asked him if he new about the alcohol related problem.\nHe said, no.\nThere is no warning on the prescription bottle, to tell you to watch out for a reaction with alcohol.\nThe Dr is now doing tests, to see if there has been any damage to my heart and muscles.\nI also, asked for physical theraphy for my left shoulder and neck.\nMy left shoulder is almost immobile.\nI think the tinnitus in my left ear has been caused by the Lipitor.\nI hope it goes away soon.\nI also, lost my sense of taste during this whole thing.\nI would recommend anyone who has experienced any side effects increased by alcohol, to consider an allergic reaction to the drug.\nDr was thinking about putting on another Statin drug.\nI said, don't you get it, I'm allergic to it.\n.\n", "mentions": [{"text": "muscle pain", "offsets": [100, 111], "concepts":
